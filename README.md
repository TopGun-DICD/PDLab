PDLab is an educational framework to perform IC's layout processing and physical design algorithms development and debugging.

The main flow of the algorithm for processing IC layout is with from separate parts - graphical modules (flow items), which are connected with their inputs and outputs.

The data obtained as a result of the execution of one module is passed to the next module. Thus, a route for the execution of the algorithm for layout processing is formed.
